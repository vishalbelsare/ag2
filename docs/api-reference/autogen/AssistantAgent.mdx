Check the execution result returned by the user.\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can\'t be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

    (In preview) Assistant agent, designed to solve a task with LLM.<br/>AssistantAgent is a subclass of ConversableAgent configured with a default system message.<br/>The default system message is designed to solve a task with LLM,
    including suggesting python code blocks and debugging.<br/>`human_input_mode` is default to "NEVER"
    and `code_execution_config` is default to False.<br/>This agent doesn't execute code by default, and expects the user to execute the code.<br/>
