This notebook aims to demonstrate how `AgentEval` works in an offline
scenario, where we use a math problem-solving task as an example.
`AgentEval` consists of two key steps:

-   `generate_criteria`: This is an LLM-based function that generates a
    list of criteria $(c_1, \dots, c_n)$ to help to evaluate a utility
    given task.

-   `quantify_criteria`: This function quantifies the performance of any
    sample task based on the criteria generated in the
    `generate_criteria` step in the following way:
    $(c_1=a_1, \dots, c_n=a_n)$

## Set your API Endpoint

-   The
    [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json)
    function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable
    or a json file. It first looks for an environment variable with a
    specified name. The value of the environment variable needs to be a
    valid json string. If that variable is not found, it looks for a
    json file with the same name. It filters the configs by filter_dict.

You can set the value of config_list in any way you prefer. Please refer
to this
[notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/oai_openai_utils.ipynb)
for full code examples of the different methods.

# Run the Critic

To run the critic, we need a couple of math problem examples. One of
them failed to solve the problem successfully, given in
`agenteval-in-out/response_failed.txt`, and the other one was solved
successfully, i.e., `agenteval-in-out/response_successful.txt`.

# The Criteria

Now, we print the designed criteria for assessing math problems.

```python
current_task_name = "_".join(task.name.split()).lower()
cr_file = open(f"../test/test_files/agenteval-in-out/{current_task_name}_criteria.json", "w")
cr_file.write(Criterion.write_json(criteria))
cr_file.close()
```

*Note :* You can also define and use your own criteria in order to feed
into the quantifier.

# The `QuantifierAgent`

Once we have the criteria, we need to quantify a new sample based on the
designed criteria and its accepted values. This will be done through
`quantify_criteria` from agent_eval. Again, you can use your own defined
criteria in `criteria_file`.

```python
criteria_file = f"../test/test_files/agenteval-in-out/{current_task_name}_criteria.json"
criteria = open(criteria_file, "r").read()
criteria = Criterion.parse_json_str(criteria)
```

## Running the quantifier on a single test case

Here, we run the quantifier on a single math problem test case,
`sample_test_case.json`, for demonstration.

```python
test_case = open("../test/test_files/agenteval-in-out/samples/sample_test_case.json", "r").read()
test_case, ground_truth = remove_ground_truth(test_case)
quantifier_output = quantify_criteria(
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    criteria=criteria,
    task=task,
    test_case=test_case,
    ground_truth=ground_truth,
)
print("actual correctness:", quantifier_output["actual_success"])
print("predicted correctness:\n", quantifier_output["estimated_performance"])
```

# Run `AgentEval` on the logs

In the example below, log_path points to the sample logs folder to run
the quantifier. The current sample belongs to the prealgebra category
which will be downloaded from
[here](https://github.com/julianakiseleva/autogen/tree/agenteval/test/test_files/agenteval-in-out/samples).
In case you want to replicate the results described in the blog post,
you can download all the logs for math problems using the following
[link](https://github.com/julianakiseleva/autogen/tree/agenteval/model-logs/math-problems/agentchat).

```python
# You can set your own log path - we also limited the number of samples to avoid additional costs.
# By removing the condition about limitations on the number of samples per category, you can run it on all 120 problems

log_path = "../test/test_files/agenteval-in-out/agentchat_results/"

# The file is no longer in the repo, we can download it from an older commit
!wget https://github.com/julianakiseleva/autogen/raw/ddabd4f0e7c13a50e33cf8462e79358666371477/test/test_files/agenteval-in-out/prealgebra.zip
