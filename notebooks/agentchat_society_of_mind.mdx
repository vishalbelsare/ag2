TODO: reimplement the society of mind agent using `register_nested_chat`
and move to the core library.

This notebook demonstrates the SocietyOfMindAgent, which runs a group
chat as an internal monologue, but appears to the external world as a
single agent. This confers three distinct advantages:

1.  It provides a clean way of producing a hierarchy of agents, hiding
    complexity as inner monologues.
2.  It provides a consistent way of extracting an answer from a lengthy
    group chat (normally, it is not clear which message is the final
    response, and the response itself may not always be formatted in a
    way that makes sense when extracted as a standalone message).
3.  It provides a way of recovering when agents exceed their context
    window constraints (the inner monologue is protected by try-catch
    blocks)

### Example Group Chat with Two Agents

In this example, we will use an AssistantAgent and a UserProxy agent
(configured for code execution) to work together to solve a problem.
Executing code requires *at least* two conversation turns (one to write
the code, and one to execute the code). If the code fails, or needs
further refinement, then additional turns may also be needed. We will
then wrap these agents in a SocietyOfMindAgent, hiding the internal
discussion from other agents (though will still appear in the console),
and ensuring that the response is suitable as a standalone message.

#### Construct the Inner-Monologue Agents

We begin by constructing the inner-monologue agents. These are the
agents that do that real work.

```python
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    "inner-assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").find("TERMINATE") >= 0,
)

code_interpreter = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    "inner-code-interpreter",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "coding",
        "use_docker": False,
    },
    default_auto_reply="",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").find("TERMINATE") >= 0,
)

groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
    agents=[assistant, code_interpreter],
    messages=[],
    speaker_selection_method="round_robin",  # With two agents, this is equivalent to a 1:1 conversation.
    allow_repeat_speaker=False,
    max_round=8,
)

manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(
    groupchat=groupchat,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").find("TERMINATE") >= 0,
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

#### Construct and Run the SocietyOfMind Agent

We now wrap the inner group-chat with the SocietyOfMind Agent, and
create a UserProxy to talk to it.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.society_of_mind_agent import SocietyOfMindAgent  # noqa: E402

task = "On which days in 2024 was Microsoft Stock higher than $370?"

society_of_mind_agent = SocietyOfMindAgent(
    "society_of_mind",
    chat_manager=manager,
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    "user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config=False,
    default_auto_reply="",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: True,
)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(society_of_mind_agent, message=task)
```

On which days in 2024 was Microsoft Stock higher than $370?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inner-assistant (to chat_manager):

To find out on which days in 2024 Microsoft stock (MSFT) was higher than $370, we would typically need to access historical stock price data. This data can be obtained from financial data providers or APIs that offer stock market data.

One common way to access such data is by using the `yfinance` library in Python, which allows us to download historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance. However, since I cannot directly access the internet or external APIs, I will provide you with a Python script that you can run on your machine to fetch the data and determine on which days MSFT was higher than $370 in 2024.

Please install the `yfinance` library if you haven't already by running `pip install yfinance` in your terminal, and then run the following Python script:

```python
# filename: msft_stock_analysis.py
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Define the ticker symbol and the date range
ticker_symbol = "MSFT"
start_date = "2024-01-01"
end_date = "2024-12-31"

# Download the historical stock prices
msft_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Filter the days where the stock price was higher than $370
days_higher_than_370 = msft_data[msft_data['Close'] > 370]

# Print the dates
print("Dates in 2024 when MSFT stock was higher than $370:")
for date in days_higher_than_370.index:
    print(date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
```

This script will download the historical data for Microsoft stock for the year 2024 and print out the dates when the closing price was higher than $370. Please run this script and provide me with the output.

It seems that the `yfinance` library has been successfully installed. Now that the library is available, please run the previously provided Python script again to fetch the historical stock prices for Microsoft and determine on which days the stock was higher than $370 in 2024.

Here is the script again for your convenience:

```python
# filename: msft_stock_analysis.py
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Define the ticker symbol and the date range
ticker_symbol = "MSFT"
start_date = "2024-01-01"
end_date = "2024-12-31"

# Download the historical stock prices
msft_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Filter the days where the stock price was higher than $370
days_higher_than_370 = msft_data[msft_data['Close'] > 370]

# Print the dates
print("Dates in 2024 when MSFT stock was higher than $370:")
for date in days_higher_than_370.index:
    print(date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
```

Please execute this script and provide me with the output.

#### Remarks

There are a few things to notice about this output: - First, the
user_proxy sent only one message to the society_of_mind agent, and
received only one message in response. As far as it is concerned, the
society_of_mind agent is the only agent in the chat. - Second, the final
response is formatted in a way that is standalone. Unlike the prior
response, it makes no reference of a previous script or execution, and
it lacks the TERMINATE keyword that ended the inner monologue.
