AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which
can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This
framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to pass a cumstomized agent
selection method to GroupChat. The customized function looks like this:

```python
def custom_speaker_selection_func(last_speaker, groupchat):
    """Define a customized speaker selection function.
    A recommended way is to define a transition for each speaker in the groupchat.

    Parameters:
        - last_speaker: Agent
            The last speaker in the group chat.
        - groupchat: GroupChat
            The GroupChat object
    Return:
        Return one of the following:
        1. an `Agent` class, it must be one of the agents in the group chat.
        2. a string from ['auto', 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin'] to select a default method to use.
        3. None, which indicates the chat should be terminated.
    """
    pass

groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
    speaker_selection_method=custom_speaker_selection_func,
    ...,
)
```

The last speaker and the groupchat object are passed to the function.
Commonly used variables from groupchat are `groupchat.messages` an
`groupchat.agents`, which is the message history and the agents in the
group chat respectively. You can access other attributes of the
groupchat, such as `groupchat.allowed_speaker_transitions_dict` for
pre-defined allowed_speaker_transitions_dict.

## Construct Agents

-   Planner: Give a plan and revise.
-   Admin: Human in the loop to approve or terminate the process.
-   Engineer: Retrieve papers from the internet by writing code.
-   Executor: Execute the code.
-   Scientist: Read the papers and write a summary.

The pipeline is the following:

1.  The planner interact with Admin (user) to revise a plan. Only when
    the Admin types “Approve”, we can move to the next step.
2.  The engineer will write code to retrieve papers from the internet.
    The code will be executed by executor.
3.  When the code is executed successfully, the scientist will read the
    papers and write a summary.
4.  The summary will be reviewed by the Admin and give comments. When
    the Admin types “TERMINATE”, the process will be terminated.

Engineer (to chat_manager):

Since the plan has been approved, I will now proceed with the first step, which is to find the latest paper about GPT-4 on arXiv. To do this, I will write a Python script that uses the arXiv API to search for papers related to GPT-4 and filter them by the most recent publications.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this task:

```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime

# Define the URL for the arXiv API
ARXIV_API_URL = "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query"

# Define the search parameters
search_query = "all:gpt-4"
start = 0
max_results = 1
sort_by = "submittedDate"
sort_order = "descending"

# Construct the query
query_params = {
    "search_query": search_query,
    "start": start,
    "max_results": max_results,
    "sortBy": sort_by,
    "sortOrder": sort_order
}

# Send the request to the arXiv API
response = requests.get(ARXIV_API_URL, params=query_params)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the response
    feed = response.text
    # Find the entry element, which contains the paper information
    start_entry = feed.find('<entry>')
    end_entry = feed.find('</entry>')
    entry = feed[start_entry:end_entry]
    
    # Extract the title
    start_title = entry.find('<title>') + 7
    end_title = entry.find('</title>')
    title = entry[start_title:end_title].strip()
    
    # Extract the published date
    start_published = entry.find('<published>') + 12
    end_published = entry.find('</published>')
    published = entry[start_published:end_published].strip()
    
    # Extract the summary
    start_summary = entry.find('<summary>') + 9
    end_summary = entry.find('</summary>')
    summary = entry[start_summary:end_summary].strip()
    
    # Extract the authors
    authors = []
    start_author = entry.find('<author>')
    end_author = entry.find('</author>')
    while start_author != -1 and end_author != -1:
        start_name = entry.find('<name>', start_author) + 6
        end_name = entry.find('</name>', start_author)
        author_name = entry[start_name:end_name].strip()
        authors.append(author_name)
        start_author = entry.find('<author>', end_author)
        end_author = entry.find('</author>', start_author)
    
    # Print the results
    print(f"Title: {title}")
    print(f"Published Date: {published}")
    print(f"Authors: {', '.join(authors)}")
    print(f"Summary: {summary}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data from arXiv API.")
```

This script will output the title, published date, authors, and summary of the most recent paper related to GPT-4 on arXiv. Please note that the actual content of the paper and its potential applications in software will need to be analyzed manually after retrieving the paper information.

Title: A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient
  Summaries with Large Language Models
Published Date: 024-02-23T16:32:28Z
Authors: Stefan Hegselmann, Shannon Zejiang Shen, Florian Gierse, Monica Agrawal, David Sontag, Xiaoyi Jiang
Summary: Patients often face difficulties in understanding their hospitalizations,
while healthcare workers have limited resources to provide explanations. In
this work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate
patient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data
on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we
develop a rigorous labeling protocol for hallucinations, and have two medical
experts annotate 100 real-world summaries and 100 generated summaries. We show
that fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations
from 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant
information. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4
when prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative
evaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows
very good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common
quantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.
Finally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which yields
promising results.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientist (to chat_manager):

Based on the abstract provided, the paper titled "A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models" explores the use of large language models, including GPT-4, to generate patient summaries from doctors' notes. The study focuses on the impact of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries and also investigates the potential of GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection.

**Potential Applications in Software:**

1. **Healthcare Documentation Automation:**
   - GPT-4 could be used to develop software that assists healthcare professionals in creating accurate and comprehensive patient summaries by automatically processing doctors' notes and other medical records.

2. **Clinical Decision Support Systems:**
   - Integrating GPT-4 into clinical decision support systems could provide healthcare workers with insights and suggestions based on a patient's medical history, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning.

3. **Patient Education and Communication:**
   - Software applications could leverage GPT-4 to translate complex medical information into patient-friendly summaries, enhancing patient understanding of their health conditions and treatments.

4. **Medical Training and Simulation:**
   - GPT-4 could be used to create realistic medical scenarios for training medical students and professionals, simulating patient interactions and generating case studies.

5. **Data Quality Assurance:**
   - The paper suggests that GPT-4 can be used for automatic hallucination detection, which refers to the identification of inaccuracies or fabrications in generated text. This could be applied to software that ensures the quality and reliability of medical documentation.

6. **Research and Development:**
   - GPT-4 could assist researchers in summarizing and synthesizing large volumes of medical literature, aiding in the discovery of new insights and the development of novel treatments.

7. **Personalized Health Monitoring:**
   - Software applications could use GPT-4 to provide personalized health monitoring and advice by analyzing user input, such as symptoms or lifestyle factors, and generating tailored health recommendations.

These potential applications highlight the versatility of GPT-4 in the realm of healthcare software, offering opportunities to enhance patient care, improve healthcare workflows, and support medical education and research.
