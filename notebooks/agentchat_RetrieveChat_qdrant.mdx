[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is a high-performance vector search
engine/database.

This notebook demonstrates the usage of Qdrant for RAG, based on
[agentchat_RetrieveChat.ipynb](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_RetrieveChat.ipynb).

RetrieveChat is a conversational system for retrieve augmented code
generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how
to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on
customized documentations that are not present in the LLM’s training
dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and
`RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of
`AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g.,
[Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution &
Debugging](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)).

We’ll demonstrate usage of RetrieveChat with Qdrant for code generation
and question answering w/ human feedback.

```

## Set your API Endpoint

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python

```

## Construct agents for RetrieveChat

We start by initializing the `AssistantAgent` and
`RetrieveUserProxyAgent`. The system message needs to be set to “You are
a helpful assistant.” for AssistantAgent. The detailed instructions are
given in the user message. Later we will use the
`RetrieveUserProxyAgent.generate_init_prompt` to combine the
instructions and a retrieval augmented generation task for an initial
prompt to be sent to the LLM assistant.

### You can find the list of all the embedding models supported by Qdrant [here](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/).

## What is FLAML

FLAML is a lightweight Python library for efficient automation of machine
learning and AI operations. It automates workflow based on large language models, machine learning models, etc.
and optimizes their performance.

- FLAML enables building next-gen GPT-X applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation and optimization of a complex GPT-X workflow. It maximizes the performance of GPT-X models and augments their weakness.
- For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range.
- It supports fast and economical automatic tuning (e.g., inference hyperparameters for foundation models, configurations in MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations), capable of handling large search space with heterogeneous evaluation cost and complex constraints/guidance/early stopping.

FLAML is powered by a series of [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research/) from Microsoft Research and collaborators such as Penn State University, Stevens Institute of Technology, University of Washington, and University of Waterloo.

FLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET.

## Installation

FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.9**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install flaml
```

Minimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need. For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`autogen`](https://docs.ag2.ai/) package.

```bash
pip install "flaml[autogen]"
```

Find more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Installation).
Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed.

## Quickstart

- (New) The [autogen](https://docs.ag2.ai/) package enables the next-gen GPT-X applications with a generic multi-agent conversation framework.
  It offers customizable and conversable agents which integrate LLMs, tools and human.
  By automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. For example,

```python
from flaml import autogen

assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent("assistant")
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent("user_proxy")
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="Show me the YTD gain of 10 largest technology companies as of today.",
)
# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task
```

Autogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers a drop-in replacement of `openai.Completion` or `openai.ChatCompletion` with powerful functionalites like tuning, caching, templating, filtering. For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.

```python
# perform tuning
config, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(
    data=tune_data,
    metric="success",
    mode="max",
    eval_func=eval_func,
    inference_budget=0.05,
    optimization_budget=3,
    num_samples=-1,
)
# perform inference for a test instance
response = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)
```

- With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast
  AutoML engine as a [scikit-learn style estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML).

```python
from flaml import AutoML

automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification")
```

- You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning
  tool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a [customized learner](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#estimator-and-search-space).

```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification", estimator_list=["lgbm"])
```

- You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a [custom function](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).

```python
from flaml import tune
tune.run(evaluation_function, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600)
```

- [Zero-shot AutoML](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Zero-Shot-AutoML) allows using the existing training API from lightgbm, xgboost etc. while getting the benefit of AutoML in choosing high-performance hyperparameter configurations per task.

```python
from flaml.default import LGBMRegressor

# Use LGBMRegressor in the same way as you use lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.
estimator = LGBMRegressor()
# The hyperparameters are automatically set according to the training data.
estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to ragproxyagent):

No, there is no function called `tune_automl` specifically mentioned in the context provided. However, FLAML does offer general hyperparameter tuning capabilities which could be related to this. In the context of FLAML, there is a generic function called `tune.run()` that can be used for hyperparameter tuning.

Here's a short example of how to use FLAML's tune for a user-defined function based on the given context:

```python
from flaml import tune

def evaluation_function(config):
    # evaluation logic that returns a metric score
    ...

# define the search space for hyperparameters
config_search_space = {
    'max_depth': tune.randint(lower=3, upper=10),
    'learning_rate': tune.loguniform(lower=1e-4, upper=1e-1),
}

# run hyperparameter tuning
tune.run(
    evaluation_function,
    config=config_search_space,
    low_cost_partial_config={'max_depth': 3},
    time_budget_s=3600
)
```

Please note that if you are referring to a different kind of function or use case, you might need to specify more details or check the official documentation or source code of the FLAML library.

You're a retrieve augmented coding assistant. You answer user's questions based on your own knowledge and the
context provided by the user.
If you can't answer the question with or without the current context, you should reply exactly `UPDATE CONTEXT`.
For code generation, you must obey the following rules:
Rule 1. You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.
Rule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```language
# your code
```

User's question is: Who is the author of FLAML?

Context is: # Research
