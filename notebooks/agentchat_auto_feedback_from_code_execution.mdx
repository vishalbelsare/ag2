In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and
`UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here
`AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a
Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task.
`UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for the human user
to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`, or automatically
execute the code. Depending on the setting of `human_input_mode` and
`max_consecutive_auto_reply`, the `UserProxyAgent` either solicits
feedback from the human user or returns auto-feedback based on the
result of code execution (success or failure and corresponding outputs)
to `AssistantAgent`. `AssistantAgent` will debug the code and suggest
new code if the result contains error. The two agents keep communicating
to each other until the task is done.

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

import autogen
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={"tags": ["gpt-4"]},  # comment out to get all

# When using a single openai endpoint, you can use the following:
# config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}]
```

## Example Task: Check Stock Price Change

In the example below, let’s see how to use the agents in AutoGen to
write a python script and execute the script. This process involves
constructing a `AssistantAgent` to serve as the assistant, along with a
`UserProxyAgent` that acts as a proxy for the human user. In this
example demonstrated below, when constructing the `UserProxyAgent`, we
select the `human_input_mode` to “NEVER”. This means that the
`UserProxyAgent` will not solicit feedback from the human user. It stops
replying when the limit defined by `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is
reached, or when `is_termination_msg()` returns true for the received
message.

```python
# create an AssistantAgent named "assistant"
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={
        "cache_seed": 41,  # seed for caching and reproducibility
        "config_list": config_list,  # a list of OpenAI API configurations
        "temperature": 0,  # temperature for sampling
    },  # configuration for autogen's enhanced inference API which is compatible with OpenAI API
)

# create a UserProxyAgent instance named "user_proxy"
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={
        # the executor to run the generated code
        "executor": LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir="coding"),
    },
)
# the assistant receives a message from the user_proxy, which contains the task description
chat_res = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="""What date is today? Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.""",
    summary_method="reflection_with_llm",

user_proxy (to assistant):

What date is today? Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

First, let's get the current date using Python. 

```python
# Python code
from datetime import date

# Get today's date
today = date.today()

# Print today's date
print("Today's date:", today)
```

Next, we need to fetch the stock prices for META (Facebook) and TESLA for the current year. We can use the `yfinance` library in Python to fetch this data. If `yfinance` is not installed, it can be installed using pip: `pip install yfinance`.

Here is the Python code to fetch the stock prices and calculate the year-to-date gain:

```python
# Python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

# Get the current year
current_year = datetime.now().year

# Download stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('FB', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)
tesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)

# Calculate the year-to-date gain for each stock
meta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data['Close'][-1] - meta_data['Close'][0]) / meta_data['Close'][0]) * 100
tesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data['Close'][-1] - tesla_data['Close'][0]) / tesla_data['Close'][0]) * 100

# Print the year-to-date gain for each stock
print(f'META year-to-date gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')
print(f'TESLA year-to-date gain: {tesla_ytd_gain}%')
```

This code fetches the closing prices for META and TESLA for the current year, calculates the year-to-date gain for each stock, and prints the results. The year-to-date gain is calculated as the percentage change in the closing price from the first trading day of the year to the most recent trading day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

I apologize for the oversight. The variable `today` was defined in the first code block but not in the second one. Let's correct this by defining `today` in the second code block as well. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, date

# Get the current year and today's date
current_year = datetime.now().year
today = date.today()

# Download stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('FB', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)
tesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=today)

# Calculate the year-to-date gain for each stock
meta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data['Close'][-1] - meta_data['Close'][0]) / meta_data['Close'][0]) * 100
tesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data['Close'][-1] - tesla_data['Close'][0]) / tesla_data['Close'][0]) * 100

# Print the year-to-date gain for each stock
print(f'META year-to-date gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')
print(f'TESLA year-to-date gain: {tesla_ytd_gain}%')
```

This code should now correctly fetch the stock prices for META and TESLA, calculate the year-to-date gain for each, and print the results.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems like the ticker symbol for Meta Platforms Inc. (formerly Facebook) has changed from 'FB' to 'META'. Let's correct this in the code. Also, it seems like the data for the current day might not be available yet, so let's fetch the data until the previous day. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Python code
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get the current year and yesterday's date
current_year = datetime.now().year
yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(1)

# Download stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('META', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=yesterday)

print(f'META year-to-date gain: {meta_ytd_gain}%')

assistant (to user_proxy):

The code has successfully fetched the stock prices for META and TESLA and calculated the year-to-date gain for each. 

As of yesterday, the year-to-date gain for META (Meta Platforms Inc.) is approximately 50.11%, and for TESLA (Tesla Inc.) it is approximately -30.86%. This means that so far this year, META's stock price has increased by about 50.11% while TESLA's stock price has decreased by about 30.86%.

Please note that stock prices can fluctuate and the exact gain may vary depending on the time of checking.

The example above involves code execution. In AutoGen, code execution is
triggered automatically by the `UserProxyAgent` when it detects an
executable code block in a received message and no human user input is
provided. Users have the option to specify a different working directory
by setting the `work_dir` argument when constructing a new instance of
the `LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor`. For Docker-based or Jupyter
kernel-based code execution, please refer to [Code Executors
Tutorial](../docs/tutorial/code-executors) for more information.

#### Check chat results

The `initiate_chat` method returns a `ChatResult` object, which is a
dataclass object storing information about the chat. Currently, it
includes the following attributes:

-   `chat_history`: a list of chat history.
-   `summary`: a string of chat summary. A summary is only available if
    a summary_method is provided when initiating the chat.
-   `cost`: a tuple of (total_cost, total_actual_cost), where total_cost
    is a dictionary of cost information, and total_actual_cost is a
    dictionary of information on the actual incurred cost with cache.
-   `human_input`: a list of strings of human inputs solicited during
    the chat. (Note that since we are setting `human_input_mode` to
    `NEVER` in this notebook, this list is always empty.)

print("Chat history:", chat_res.chat_history)

To plot a chart of the stock price change year-to-date (YTD) for META and TESLA, and to save the data and the plot, we can use the `matplotlib` and `pandas` libraries in Python. If these libraries are not installed, they can be installed using pip: `pip install matplotlib pandas`.

Here is the Python code to fetch the stock prices, plot the chart, and save the data and the plot:

```python
# Python code

# Get the current year and yesterday's date
current_year = datetime.now().year
yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(1)

# Download stock data for the current year
meta_data = yf.download('META', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=yesterday)
tesla_data = yf.download('TSLA', start=f'{current_year}-01-01', end=yesterday)

# Plot the closing prices
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))

plt.plot(tesla_data['Close'], label='TESLA')
plt.title('META vs TESLA Stock Price YTD')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Closing Price')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig('stock_price_ytd.png')

# Save the data to a CSV file
data = pd.concat([meta_data['Close'], tesla_data['Close']], axis=1)
data.columns = ['META', 'TESLA']
data.to_csv('stock_price_ytd.csv')
```

This code fetches the closing prices for META and TESLA for the current year, plots the closing prices, saves the plot to 'stock_price_ytd.png', and saves the closing prices to 'stock_price_ytd.csv'.

assistant (to user_proxy):

The code has successfully fetched the stock prices for META and TESLA, plotted the chart of their stock price change year-to-date (YTD), and saved the data to 'stock_price_ytd.csv' and the plot to 'stock_price_ytd.png'.

You can now view the chart in the 'stock_price_ytd.png' file and the data in the 'stock_price_ytd.csv' file in your current working directory.

## Example Task: Use User Defined Message Function to let Agents Analyze data Collected

Let’s create a user defined message to let the agents analyze the raw
data and write a blogpost. The function is supposed to take `sender`,
`recipient` and `context` as inputs and outputs a string of message.

\*\*kwargs from `initiate_chat` will be used as `context`. Take the
following code as an example, the `context` includes a field `file_name`
as provided in `initiate_chat`. In the user defined message function
`my_message_generator`, we are reading data from the file specified by
this filename.

```python
def my_message_generator(sender, recipient, context):
    # your CSV file
    file_name = context.get("file_name")
    try:
        with open(file_name, mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            file_content = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        file_content = "No data found."
    return "Analyze the data and write a brief but engaging blog post. \n Data: \n" + file_content


# followup of the previous question
chat_res = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=assistant,
    message=my_message_generator,
    file_name="coding/stock_price_ytd.csv",
    summary_method="reflection_with_llm",
    summary_args={"summary_prompt": "Return the blog post in Markdown format."},
)
```

To analyze this data and write a blog post, we first need to load the data into a pandas DataFrame, then perform some basic analysis on it. We can then use the results of this analysis to write the blog post.

Here is the Python code to load the data and perform the analysis:

```python
# Python code
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

data = """
Date,META,TESLA
2024-01-02,346.2900085449219,248.4199981689453
2024-01-03,344.4700012207031,238.4499969482422
...
2024-04-10,519.8300170898438,171.75999450683594
"""

# Load the data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data))

# Calculate the mean, max, min, and standard deviation for each stock
meta_mean = df['META'].mean()
meta_max = df['META'].max()
meta_min = df['META'].min()
meta_std = df['META'].std()

tesla_mean = df['TESLA'].mean()
tesla_max = df['TESLA'].max()
tesla_min = df['TESLA'].min()
tesla_std = df['TESLA'].std()

# Print the results
print(f"META - Mean: {meta_mean}, Max: {meta_max}, Min: {meta_min}, Std: {meta_std}")
print(f"TESLA - Mean: {tesla_mean}, Max: {tesla_max}, Min: {tesla_min}, Std: {tesla_std}")
```

After running this code, we can use the results to write the blog post. Here is a possible blog post based on the results:

Title: A Comparative Analysis of META and TESLA Stocks in Early 2024

In the first quarter of 2024, the stock market saw some interesting movements in the tech sector. Two companies that stood out during this period were META and TESLA. 

META, the social media giant, had an average stock price of [META Mean] during this period. The highest it reached was [META Max], while the lowest was [META Min]. The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the prices were, was [META Std].

On the other hand, TESLA, the electric vehicle and clean energy company, had an average stock price of [TESLA Mean]. The stock reached a high of [TESLA Max] and a low of [TESLA Min]. The standard deviation for TESLA was [TESLA Std].

These figures show that both META and TESLA had their ups and downs during this period. However, the higher standard deviation for [Company with higher Std] indicates that its stock price fluctuated more compared to [Company with lower Std].

As we move further into 2024, it will be interesting to see how these trends evolve. Will META and TESLA continue on their current trajectories, or will we see a shift in the market dynamics? Only time will tell.

Please replace [META Mean], [META Max], [META Min], [META Std], [TESLA Mean], [TESLA Max], [TESLA Min], [TESLA Std], [Company with higher Std], and [Company with lower Std] with the actual values obtained from the Python code.

In the first quarter of 2024, the stock market saw some interesting
movements in the tech sector. Two companies that stood out during this
period were META and TESLA.

META, the social media giant, had an average stock price of 403.53
during this period. The highest it reached was 519.83, while the lowest
was 344.47. The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the
prices were, was 100.72.

On the other hand, TESLA, the electric vehicle and clean energy company,
had an average stock price of 219.54. The stock reached a high of 248.42
and a low of 171.76. The standard deviation for TESLA was 41.68.

These figures show that both META and TESLA had their ups and downs

indicates that its stock price fluctuated more compared to TESLA.

As we move further into 2024, it will be interesting to see how these
trends evolve. Will META and TESLA continue on their current
trajectories, or will we see a shift in the market dynamics? Only time
will tell.
