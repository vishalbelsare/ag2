This notebook showcases how to use the new chat interface
`autogen.initiate_chats` to solve a set of tasks with a sequence of
chats.

### Example Tasks

Below are three example tasks, with each task being a string of text
describing the request. The completion of later tasks requires or
benefits from the results of previous tasks.

```python
financial_tasks = [
    """What are the current stock prices of NVDA and TESLA, and how is the performance over the past month in terms of percentage change?""",
    """Investigate possible reasons of the stock performance leveraging market news.""",
]

writing_tasks = ["""Develop an engaging blog post using any information provided."""]
```

### Example 1: Solve tasks with a series of chats

The `autogen.initiate_chats` interface can take a list of dictionaries
as inputs. Each dictionary preserves the following fields:

-   `sender`: a conversable agent as the sender;
-   `recipient`: a conversable agent as the recipient;
-   `message`: is a string of text (typically a message containing the
    task) or a callable;
-   `summary_method`: A string or a callable to get a summary from the
    chat. Currently supported choices include `last_msg`, which takes
    the last message from the chat history as the summary, and
    `reflection_with_llm`, which uses an LLM call to reflect on the chat
    history and summarize a takeaway;

```python
financial_assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Financial_assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
research_assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Researcher",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
writer = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="writer",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message="""
        You are a professional writer, known for
        your insightful and engaging articles.
        You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.
        Reply "TERMINATE" in the end when everything is done.
        """,
)

user_proxy_auto = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="User_Proxy_Auto",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),

    },  # Please set use_docker=True if docker is available to run the generated code. Using docker is safer than running the generated code directly.
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="User_Proxy",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS",  # ask human for input at each step
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),

    [
        {
            "sender": user_proxy_auto,
            "recipient": financial_assistant,

            "summary_method": "reflection_with_llm",
        },
        {
            "sender": user_proxy,

            "message": writing_tasks[0],

        },
    ]
)
```

User_Proxy_Auto (to Financial_assistant):

What are the current stock prices of NVDA and TESLA, and how is the performance over the past month in terms of percentage change?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial_assistant (to User_Proxy_Auto):

To get the current stock prices of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) and TSLA (Tesla, Inc.), along with their performance over the past month in terms of percentage change, we can use a Python library like `yfinance`. This library allows downloading of historical market data from Yahoo Finance.

Let's proceed in the following steps:

1. I will provide you a Python script that utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch the current stock prices and historical data for the past month for both NVDA and TSLA.
2. The script will then calculate the percentage change in the stock prices over the past month.

Please make sure that you have `yfinance` installed in your Python environment before running the script. You can install it using `pip install yfinance`.

Here is the Python code to execute:

```python
# filename: stock_info.py
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Function to get current stock price
def get_stock_price(stock_ticker):
    stock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)
    todays_data = stock.history(period='1d')
    return todays_data['Close'][0]

# Function to calculate percentage change over the past month
def get_percentage_change(stock_ticker):
    stock = yf.Ticker(stock_ticker)
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)
    historical_data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
    price_end = historical_data['Close'][-1]
    price_start = historical_data['Close'][0]
    percent_change = ((price_end - price_start)/price_start) * 100
    return percent_change

# Getting the current price and performance for NVDA and TSLA
nvda_price = get_stock_price('NVDA')
tesla_price = get_stock_price('TSLA')
nvda_change = get_percentage_change('NVDA')
tesla_change = get_percentage_change('TSLA')

# Output the results
print(f"NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) stock price: ${nvda_price:.2f}")
print(f"TESLA (Tesla, Inc.) stock price: ${tesla_price:.2f}")
print(f"NVDA percentage change over past month: {nvda_change:.2f}%")
print(f"TESLA percentage change over past month: {tesla_change:.2f}%")
```

Please run this script in your environment and share with me the output. I'll then verify the information.

User_Proxy_Auto (to Financial_assistant):

exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output: 
NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) stock price: $732.36
TESLA (Tesla, Inc.) stock price: $200.46
NVDA percentage change over past month: 30.65%
TESLA percentage change over past month: -7.00%


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial_assistant (to User_Proxy_Auto):

Great! According to the executed script, the current stock price for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is $732.36, with a positive percentage change of 30.65% over the past month, indicating notable growth. Meanwhile, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) has a current stock price of $200.46, but it has experienced a negative percentage change of -7.00% over the past month, indicating a decrease in its value.

It seems that NVIDIA has had a particularly strong performance over the past month, while Tesla has seen a decline in its stock price. Keep in mind that the stock market can be influenced by a wide array of factors, including but not limited to company performance, industry shifts, market trends, and global economic conditions.

Please ensure to verify these figures with real-time data or additional financial news sources to get the most up-to-date information, as the stock market is volatile and prices can change rapidly.

If you need any further assistance or have additional questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, that concludes our task.

Researcher (to User_Proxy_Auto):

To investigate the possible reasons for the stock performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), we can gather recent market news related to these companies. This may provide insights into any events or announcements that could have influenced investor sentiment and thus the stock price. 

I will now write a Python script to search for recent news articles for both NVDA and TSLA using a web scraping library. Please note that this script will return the latest publicly available news gathered from news websites that provide RSS feeds or have structured data appropriate for scraping. For more in-depth analysis, professional financial services or databases like Bloomberg Terminal would be more suitable, though these often require subscriptions. 

Let's proceed with the Python code to fetch recent news headlines for both companies:

```python
# filename: fetch_stock_news.py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Define the URLs of the news sources you want to scrape
# As an example, I'm using Google News RSS feed URLs for NVIDIA and Tesla.
# You can change these URLs to any other news source that you prefer.
nvidia_news_url = "https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=NVIDIA+NVDA+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
tesla_news_url = "https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Tesla+TSLA+when:7d&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

def fetch_news(url):
    # Send a request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Request to {url} failed with status code {response.status_code}")
    
    # Parse HTML content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, features='xml')
    articles = soup.find_all('item')

    # Extract news titles
    news_headlines = [article.title.text for article in articles]

    return news_headlines

def main():
    # Fetch news for NVIDIA
    print("Recent NVIDIA (NVDA) News Headlines:")
    try:
        nvidia_news = fetch_news(nvidia_news_url)
        for idx, headline in enumerate(nvidia_news, 1):
            print(f"{idx}. {headline}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching NVIDIA news: {e}")

    print("\n")  # Add a newline for better readability

    # Fetch news for Tesla
    print("Recent Tesla (TSLA) News Headlines:")
    try:
        tesla_news = fetch_news(tesla_news_url)
        for idx, headline in enumerate(tesla_news, 1):
            print(f"{idx}. {headline}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching Tesla news: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please save this script as `fetch_stock_news.py` and run it. After running the script, you will receive the latest news headlines for both NVIDIA and Tesla that might help explain their recent stock performance changes.

Researcher (to User_Proxy_Auto):

Analyzing the provided news headlines, we can attempt to comprehend why NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock prices have shown differing performance over the past month.

For NVIDIA (NVDA), several headlines suggest positive catalysts:

1. **Earnings Growth and Optimism**: There are multiple news headlines indicating expectations of earnings growth and raised price targets by various investment firms (e.g., Piper Sandler, Susquehanna).
2. **Market Value Increase**: NVIDIA has reportedly overtaken Google Parent Alphabet as the third-largest US company by market value, reflecting high investor confidence.
3. **Investment and Stake Increases**: There are reports of institutional investors increasing stakes in NVIDIA, indicating bullish sentiment in the investment community.
4. **Focus on AI and Technology Advancements**: NVIDIA is discussed in the context of artificial intelligence, with investment in AI companies and anticipation of revenue from AI-related technology.
5. **Bullish Analyst Reports and Price Target Increases**: Various analysts have raised their price targets for NVIDIA's stock, offering a positive outlook for the company's future.

For Tesla (TSLA), the headlines suggest a mix of concerns and opportunities:

1. **Stock Price Volatility**: Headlines note Tesla's stock price volatility and the negative bearish sentiment among some institutional investors.
2. **Management and Corporate Governance Query**: There are references to concerns regarding Elon Musk's focus and the impact of his managerial decisions on Tesla's business.
3. **Possibility of Slowing EV Demand**: Some articles suggest a slump in demand for electric vehicles, which could be impacting Tesla's sales and valuation.
4. **Economic Overview and Macro Factors**: Reports indicate that the wider economic conditions, such as inflation reports and potential slowdown, may be influencing Tesla's stock performance.
5. **Price Adjustments and Strategy**: Tesla is making price adjustments to its vehicle lineup, which can indicate a strategy to boost demand or respond to market pressures.

From this qualitative analysis of the recent news headlines, we can infer that NVIDIA's stock price increase may be driven by positive financial expectations, advancements in AI technologies, and increased investment interest. In contrast, Tesla's decline might be influenced by market concerns about demand and potential impacts of economic factors, as well as governance and strategy questions related to Elon Musk's leadership.

Investors often consider such news and analyst reports when making investment decisions, which can lead to the changes in stock performance observed. It is important to remember that stock market performance is multifaceted and can be influenced by a large variety of factors, including those not mentioned in the latest news headlines. For a complete understanding of any stock's performance, an in-depth analysis including financial statements, market trends, and expert analysis would be necessary.

**The Tale of Two Tech Giants: A Stock Market Saga**

In the ever-changing landscape of the stock market, the tales of rising stars and waning giants are narrated daily through the cold, hard numbers flashing on traders' screens. In the latest chapter of this financial epic, we turn our gaze to two behemoths of innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Each tells a story as captivating as the next, but with decidedly different plot twists.

**NVIDIA's Ascension: A Graphical Powerhouse**

Picture this: a company whose fortunes are soaring, much like the rockets that its technology could one day help to navigate through the stars. NVIDIA, known for transforming pixels into beautiful imagery, is now transforming its numbers with just as much finesse. Let's delve into the specifics with a table that paints a thousand words—or in this case, numbers:

| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |
| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |

What we see is a whopping 30.65% increase in NVIDIA's stock price over the past month. But what has fueled this impressive growth? Analysts might point to a confluence of factors: a resounding optimism in earnings growth, NVIDIA's coronation as the third-largest US company by market value, a strong current of institutional investor confidence, and a strategic play in the buzz-filled field of artificial intelligence.

**Tesla's Twist: When Currents Shift**

Contrast this with the journey Tesla has embarked upon. Once a darling of the market, it presently faces a twist in its narrative, marked by a 7% decrease in its stock price within the same timeframe. Tesla's plot thickens with a concoction of concerns: a potential slowdown in the electric vehicle market, turbulence sewn by bearish institutional sentiment, a series of questions around corporate governance, and the larger, shadowy figure of global economic uncertainty that lurks in the background.

**Deciphering the Stories Behind the Statistics**

What these figures don't capture is the rich tapestry of human decisions, innovations, fears, and aspirations that drive them. NVIDIA's current favored status among investors may be underpinned by its key strides in technology that promise to unlock new capabilities in various sectors, while Tesla's challenges might reflect the intricate dance of market expectations with real-world deliverables. Each stock price movement is a reflection of myriad stories unfolding within and around these corporate giants.

**An Investor's Prose: Caution Amidst Narratives**

As a savvy observer of the market's grand narrative, caution remains a protagonist. Remember, stock prices are as volatile as the oceans—serene one day, stormy the next. While NVIDIA's rise and Tesla's stumble are today's headlines, tomorrow might tell a different tale. For the most accurate pulse, ensure you're synced with the heartbeat of the market through real-time data and a diversified suite of financial news sources.

Today, NVIDIA basks in the glow of market approval, while Tesla navigates a patch of rough seas. But as any veteran of the markets will tell you, fortunes can reverse in the blink of an eye. As long as innovation remains at their core and adaptability in their strategies, both companies are poised for the next chapter in their storied existences.

And whether as cautionary tale or heroic epic, you can be certain that the market will be there to tell the tale.

**The Silicon Symbiosis: A Contrast in Fortunes**

In the realm of high technology and financial markets, the narrative is as dynamic as it is unpredictable. Every tradesman's tick and investor's tock is part of an intricate symphony, with movements both adagio and allegro. Today, we cast our spotlight on two titans that have come to symbolically represent the march of modern innovation: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). Their stories, though interwoven by the common thread of cutting-edge technology, are currently humming different melodies in the stock market concerto.

**NVIDIA's Flourishing Financial Canvas**

Allow me to direct your eyes to a visual that speaks volumes—a financial figure that captivates the analytical mind as surely as a work of art steals the gaze of its onlooker:

*Table 1: Comparative Stock Performances*

| Company | Current Stock Price | Percentage Change (Last Month) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| NVIDIA (NVDA) | $732.36             | +30.65%                        |
| Tesla (TSLA)  | $200.46             | -7.00%                         |

In just one month, NVIDIA has seen a dramatic surge in its stock price, a robust 30.65% climb that mirrors the steep inclines of a mountainous ascent. Yet, this ascent is no mere accident of fate. It has been prodded by a series of catalysts, each more powerful than the last. Analysts may suggest that NVIDIA's performance is reflective of a positive outlook on earnings growth, the magnifying glass of confidence from institutional investors, and its strategic investment in artificial intelligence—a field that promises to redefine the boundaries of possibility.

This growth is no less significant for having catapulted NVIDIA to newfound heights, positioning it as the third-largest U.S. company by market value. In the eyes of many, NVIDIA is not merely a company but a canvas upon which the future of technology is being painted.

**Tesla's Tales of Caution and Volatility**

In sharp contrast stands Tesla, the electric automaker whose brand has become synonymous with the future of transportation. Despite the sheen of innovation and Elon Musk's vision, the company's current stock price reflects a narrative tinged with uncertainty. The -7% dip might be seen as a momentary pause in the company’s otherwise stellar performance, but it whispers tales of doubt regarding slowing electric vehicle demand and the complex ballet of investor sentiment in the face of corporate governance queries and Musk's multifaceted public persona.

The fluctuating script encapsulating Tesla's value also underscores the inherent volatility of the stock market, heavily influenced by external economic narratives and internal corporate dramas. Tesla's story is a complex one, layered with futuristic ambitions tempered by the current climate of economic restraint.

**The Interplay of Market Forces and Human Emotion**

Beyond the arithmetic of stock prices lies the human element: the restless drive for invention against the cautious tug of preservation. NVIDIA’s surge speaks of human ambition crystallized into financial momentum, while Tesla’s recent dip reflects the cautious pullback of a market wary of sprinting ahead of its own shadow.

But these stock price reflections are but shadows of a larger drama—the ebb and flow of market sentiments that can turn on the dime of a quarterly report or a tweet-storm. The savvy investor or curious spectator must look beneath the surface waves to the currents below, charting movements with the precision of a cartographer mapping uncharted seas.

**Heed the Market's Mutable Muse**

We conclude with a note of prudence: embrace the complex stories of NVIDIA and Tesla, but anchor your investment decisions in the bedrock of real-time data and comprehensive analytics. The stock market is a creature of change, and its story is written anew each day. Embrace the power of informed speculation, but be wary of the market's mutable muse.

For as the curtains fall on today's account of NVIDIA's stellar ascension and Tesla's contemplative descent, one can only wonder what twists the next act will hold. The market is, after all, the grandest theater of all—a stage where fortunes are made and dreams may either be woven into reality or unravel before the audience's eyes.

As the tales of these two tech giants continue to unfold, whether they lead to further success or unexpected downturns, they exemplify the vibrancy and the volatility inherent in our quest to predicate the future on the promise of progress.

What are daily stock prices of NVDA and TESLA in the past month. Save the results in a .md file named 'stock_prices.md'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial_researcher (to User_Proxy_Auto):

To accomplish this task, I will write a Python script that utilizes an API to fetch the daily stock prices of NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) over the past month. I will then format the data into Markdown and save it to a file named 'stock_prices.md'.

Step 1: Fetch the stock price data.
Step 2: Format the data into Markdown.
Step 3: Save the data to 'stock_prices.md'.

We'll use the `yfinance` library to fetch the stock data. It's a popular choice for financial data extraction. If you don't have `yfinance` installed, you would need to install it via pip (`!pip install yfinance` in Jupyter notebooks or `pip install yfinance` in the command line). 

Let's start with step 1 by writing a script to collect the stock price data of NVDA and TSLA.

```python
# filename: fetch_stock_data.py

import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Function to fetch the stock data
def fetch_stock_data(ticker):
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)
    
    # Fetching the historical data
    stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    
    # Formatting the date to a more readable form
    stock_data.index = stock_data.index.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    
    return stock_data

# Fetching data for NVDA and TSLA
nvda_data = fetch_stock_data('NVDA')
tesla_data = fetch_stock_data('TSLA')

# Formatting the data into Markdown
with open('stock_prices.md', 'w') as md_file:
    md_file.write('# Stock Prices for NVDA and TSLA in the Past Month\n\n')
    md_file.write('## NVDA\n\n')
    md_file.write(nvda_data['Close'].to_markdown() + '\n\n')
    md_file.write('## TSLA\n\n')
    md_file.write(tesla_data['Close'].to_markdown() + '\n\n')

print("Stock prices fetched and saved to 'stock_prices.md'.")
```

Execute this script after ensuring that `yfinance` is installed. It will fetch the data and save it to 'stock_prices.md'.

# A Rollercoaster Month: The Tale of NVDA and TSLA Stock Prices

Welcome to our latest analysis where we bring the ups and downs of the stock market to life. If you've been keeping an eye on the tech industry, you've probably noticed the electrifying performance of two market giants: NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). Over the past month, these stocks have taken investors on quite the ride, and we're here to break down the twists and turns.

## NVIDIA: A Journey Through the Digital Realm

NVIDIA, the powerhouse behind some of the most advanced graphics processing technologies, began February modestly at $661.60. However, it didn't take long for this tech titan to start climbing. By February 5, we saw NVDA accelerating to a cool $693.32, hinting at the potential for a thrilling month ahead. The momentum wasn't constant, though, with minor dips, like the one on February 6th to $682.23, reminding shareholders that the journey wouldn't be without its bumps.

Midway through the month, there came a slight calm before the storm, as the stock hovered around $720, suggesting that something big was on the horizon. And true to form, on February 22nd, NVIDIA took everyone by surprise as it surged to an impressive $785.38.

The climax of this exhilarating ride came as February gave way to March, with NVIDIA stock skyrocketing to an apex of $822.79. Investors buckled in tight surely enjoyed the view from this peak.

## Tesla: Charging Ahead with Volatility

Tesla, well-loved and -debated for its visionary approach to automotive technology, also delivered its fair share of market excitement. Starting on a lower key at $187.91, TSLA had a more modest opening than NVDA but held promise for an interesting chapter.

The stock dropped to a monthly low of $181.06 on February 5, causing a bit of heart-in-mouth for supporters. Yet, in classic Tesla fashion, the company steered back onto the track, recovering to $185.10 the next day. Over the next few days, Tesla continued to inch higher, reaching $189.56 by February 8th.

Despite a temporary retreat mid-month, where the stock dipped to $188.13, the electric automaker charged back with vigor, breaking the $200 barrier and hitting a high of $200.45 on February 15th - giving investors a much-needed adrenaline boost.

As February ended and March began, Tesla maintained a price over $200, somewhat steadying the wheel for a close at $202.64, a reassuring end to a month of market fluctuations.

## What's Behind the Movements?

While the numbers tell one story, they don't explain the 'why' behind these market rides. For NVIDIA, a series of positive earnings reports, strategic partnerships, and strong demand for gaming and server GPUs contributed to its stock gains. For Tesla, market sentiment often hinged on production milestones, regulatory news, and the ever-present Twitter activity of its CEO, Elon Musk.

It's important to remember that the stock market is influenced by a complex web of factors, including investor sentiment, industry trends, geopolitical events, and economic indicators. As such, companies like NVIDIA and Tesla don't just operate in a vacuum—every shift in the market can be an echo of larger global narratives.

## An Investor's Perspective

The past month's performance of NVDA and TSLA provides valuable lessons for investors. It showcases the importance of staying informed and understanding that volatility is part and parcel of the investing experience, especially in sectors like technology where innovation is rapid and competition fierce.

While these price swings may cause some to balk, seasoned stock market enthusiasts know that these fluctuations can present opportunities. Whether leveraging these movements for short-term gains or buckling in for the long haul, understanding the story behind the numbers is crucial.

In conclusion, the tale of NVDA and TSLA over the past month has been nothing short of a nail-biter. As we keep our eyes glued to the screens for the next series of movements, always remember: investing is not just about the figures; it's about seeing the whole picture and appreciating every twist and turn of the story that unfolds.

Stay tuned, fasten your seatbelts, and until next time, may your portfolio's story be equally thrilling and rewarding.
